# Inspiration
The whole world has come to a standstill to fight the major pandemic that has had such a massive effect globally. Being a technologist, we would like to solve this problem faced by the world during pandemic outbreak. Testing people in the early phase of outbreak is one of the solution to stop pandemic. To test more people we need to filter people with high chances of infection rather than blindly testing everyone. Our idea aims to solve this issue of effective testing of COVID-19 affected people, to help ease the government and provide effective use of testing kits.

# Code
The inital development involves deep learning based convolution neural network to predict whether an audio sample belongs to:
*  Non-Cough Audio sample : Random Audio Sample.
*  Cough Audio Sample : Audio Samples containing coughing sounds.
* As part of deploying model ,wrote simple python based web app to deploy in Amazon AWS EC2 and hosted website in cloud to let users test audio samples in real time.
* Work is planned to extend to identify covid cough when public dataset is made available.
